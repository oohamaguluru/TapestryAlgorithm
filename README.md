What is working : 
                  Given n nodes and p requests. All the nodes will perform p requests and the maximum hop count is calculated and is printed as output. 
                  

process to run : 
     Navigate to folder project3 after unzip and run using :
                   mix run project3.exs numNodes numRequests
                        e.g :  mix run project3.exs 100 2

largest network:
            largest network we managed to deal is 65000 nodes and the max hop count obtained is 4.
